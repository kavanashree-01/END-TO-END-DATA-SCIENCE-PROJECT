*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*DOMAIN* : DATA SCIENCE

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR* : NEELA SANTOSH

*PROGRAM DESCRIPTION*:

This program is designed for an end-to-end data science project focused on predicting traffic volume on the Metro Interstate based on weather and time features. The project is structured into several key phases: Data Exploration & Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Development, Model Evaluation, API Development with Flask, and Deployment.

Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
The notebook loads a dataset covering the traffic volume along with weather and time-related features. It basically checks the structure of the dataset, the presence of missing values, and visualizes the distribution of traffic volume. Key preprocessing steps include changing date-time columns, extracting temporal features (hour, day of the week, month, weekend flag), treating holidays, changing temperature units, and one-hot encoding the categorical weather data. The outliers in the dependent variables (traffic volume) are detected and, if necessary, removed. 

Feature Engineering:
It creates some additional features to augment the dataset's predictive power such as time-based categories (morning peak, midday, evening peak, night) and weather severity categorizations. Missing values in these extra features and dataset cleaning are addressed. 

Model Development & Evaluation:
Not much is described in the above snippet about the model development and evaluation, although these references are made in the notebook. This probably covers training machine learning models (e.g., regression or time series models) to predict traffic volume and evaluating them using metrics such as RMSE or MAE.

API Development & Deployment:
These include the building of a Flask API that is used to serve the predictions and the deployment of models for real-world use. There are other such hints that point out that the notebook might incorporate these later onto the external resources.

Uses:
Traffic Prediction: The program helps predict traffic volume, aiding urban planning, traffic management, and infrastructure development.

Data Analysis: It provides insights into how weather and time features influence traffic patterns.

Educational Tool: The notebook serves as a practical example of a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning to model deployment.

API Integration: The Flask API component allows the model to be used in applications or systems requiring real-time traffic predictions.
